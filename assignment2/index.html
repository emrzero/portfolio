           &iexcl;Saludos! I am Eliot Reyes, an IT professional who, like most in the trade, taught himself the basics of Desktop Support. The next challenge was to tackle network  and infrastructure technology. I remember staring at a command line interface and thinking, "What in the world can I do with this?" Little did I know that Linux servers power the internet and a vast majority of mobile devices. Now, I'm foraging into the world of full-stack development. How exciting to be met with a world of possibilities!

          There's a saying in Spanish which says, "The English language is to do business; French is to speak to your lover; and Spanish is how we speak to God." I'm a polyglot, and I love all things Spanish and French.

          Literature and short stories are my favorite form of entertainment. When I don't have my nose in a book, I'm hiking in the Angeles National Forest, the Santa Monica mountains, or riding my bike in the bustling streets of Los Angeles, the greatest city in the world.
